Description: Genomics data often stored in a matrix like format, where each row is a feature (gene, transcript, protein etc.) and column is a variable (e.g. expression value in RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Pol-II ChIP-seq etc.). Variables are often grouped by replicates, time-point or specific experimental conditions such as wild type, delition, control, treatment etc. In such a multidimental data, plotting a x-y scatter plot between diffrent groups require lots of data wrangling before we input them for final ggplot.
    corplot has functions to generate heatbox and pairwise scatterplots directly from feature matix given in a tbl format. Letâ€™s have a look into required input data and resultant plots outof corpot.
